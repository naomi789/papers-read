2017 August 8th Mary Wooters (CS Theory)
Reed-Solomon codes (RS codes) are the standard (used in Voyager space craft, etc)
if k = number of data blocks
and n = # of encoded blocks
we can use algebra to graph the nodes, esentially, (deal w/ storage overhead and fault tolerance) 
striping data across the server (has first block of data goes on one server, second on second, etc) 
using algebra to help store all of your data
picking k or n as "number that is deemed safe"
