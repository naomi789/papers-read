-Playbook from CCDC
-what to do when your network is under attack/is compromised but still need to meet business needs

Attack Surface:
...

First Steps:
-secure user accounts
-secure core windows os
a. set up a firewall (default windows7+ isn't bad)
b. manage AD functionality (active directory)
c. apply updates and security patches (windows is trying to help you!! but at CCDC people will delete your updates)
d. hunt malware 
-asses web services and secure service accounts

Next:
Let's install VMs and mess around for a bit

Google link with playbook (I'll download it and include it as a .pdf)
Discussed some pieces of the playbook:
-foldershares, netshares (dangers of exposed data)
-incident reports (mitigating damages, find evidence it was malware, improve network, documenting your response)
-NetBIOS over TCP/IP
-scheduled tasks (things that need to happen automatically on windows. Use 'at' or 'schtasks')
-deleting cashed credentials (makes things SLOWER but MORE SECURE)
-sysinternals ('benign things' taking up a really long time bc malicious things are masquerading)
-virus total 
-process explorer (seeing a tree of what is running and where)
