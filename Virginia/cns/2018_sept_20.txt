Addressing
-IP (Internet Protocol) address identifies the computer on the network
--> IPv4 (current standard; ARIN already ran out)
--> MAC an address burned into the NIC

-NAT helps to connect to networks 
--> all computers have private and public IP

HARDWARE:
-transmision (ethernet,...)
-

PACKETS 
-units of data
-generally small
-...

PROTOCOLS:
-rules (govern interactions between machines)
-handshake/transmisison process
-port = specific communication channel
-ranges from 0 to 2^(16)-1
-TCP
--> Very reliable bc you check to see if you got it
--> SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK handshake
UDP
--> User Data Protocol (doesn't resend/know if you got it, but is faster)
(often used for real time data/videos/gaming. It's ok if you miss a few frames as long as it's fast)
TCP and UDP don't clonflict

OTHER PROTOCOLS INCLUDE:
ARP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP

TCP Packets: 
-32 bits
-lots of data

UDP packets:
-much less data

OTHER TOOLS & COMMANDS:
-nmap
-ifconfig/ipconfig
-whois (shows names and address of person who owns site)
-nslookup
-netminer
-tedump
