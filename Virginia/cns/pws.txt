Trends in 2018:
-supply chain attacks
-asset management (known vulnerabilities are not fixed/patched)
-data security (health care, airlines, prereq data for govt secuirty clearances, etc)
-IoT 
-email attack vector (phising, etc. Most common vector of attack, esp to corporate accounts)
-employee attack surface 

Discussion of how stuff has been changing:
-medical offices get your id, insurance, and credit card before you even see the doctors
-doctors are still terrible at transferring data safely
-universities that used to have social security numbers on students' id cards

Who attacks?
-state sponsored
-financially motivated
-malicious insiders
-ideologically motivated
(general sophistication high-> low (top -> bottom))

Anatomy of an attack:
-recon
-initial compromise
-establish foohold
-escalate privlidges (start cycle here)
-internal recon
-move laterally
-expand presence (go back to start of cycle)
-exfiltrate data/complete mission

More on healthcare:
-loss of life on line: changing insulin dosage, keeping out data about surgeries
-holding data on ransom (should we pay or not...?)

Other attacks:
-doxing people (didn't realize that was considered cybersecurity threat)
-crypocurrency mining malware (Cryptojacking) (using computing power of a device to hack other machines)
-dumb links in emails (missing packages, free baseball tickets, other stuff people really want to click on)

Tips to defend against attacks (not IF but WHEN)
-awareness and training
-focus on key data/"crown jewels"
-focus on information supply chain
-information sharing
-external threat intelligence
-detection = more improtant than prevention
-have a plan

-(listed various things)

How to learn things?
-read papers, go ot conferences, etc
-read security blogs
