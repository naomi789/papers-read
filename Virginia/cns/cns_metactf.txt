Keynote NSA Marianne Bailey
(Deputy National Manager)
Office of the National Manager for National Security Systems

Coming here:
-NSA = big fan of security/educational competitions
-thanks to who came/set up/ran program

Why this matters:
-cyber is threatening our way of life
-threat is pervasive (to ALL SECTORS: energy, finance, democracy, health, etc)
-->nice because we have job security, but... bad. 
-how tech can help us (and how those benefits can be in danger)

Cyber seccurity is evolving/interconnected
-image of a bad guy/girl in a black hoodie, at a keyboard
-but it's more than that: they have automation, alerts, etc

Dangers: China, Russia, DPRK (Korea), Iran
(called "peer adversary" (used to be "near peer" but they're more advanced now)

OPM (Office of personal management)'s breach ~2 years ago
(EVERYTHING: cars, credit history, fingerprints, etc were in those files)
First set of letters to victims cost $500,000 FOR STAMPS ONLY
$1 billion for the breach

CYBER IN THE WORKPLACE:
-having to turn off automated machines when you get a red alert
(if it's a false alarm, will your boss let you stop everything next year?)
-but what if a machine turns left when you thought it'd go right (and kills someone)
-workplaces that forbid wireless machines (when you bring a crockpot to a potluck party and it's sending out signals... then what??)

You will NEVER want for a job. 

How/when/why should offense e separate from defense

What must be done:
-patch management
-least priviledge administtration
-multi-factor authentication
-knowing your network (too many people VPNing in, vendors, contractors, etc)
-daily backups
-white listing
-enable logging/doing analysis
-harden (??)
-data encryption
94% OF 2017 INCIDENTS WERE PREVENTABLE WITH BEST PRACTICES

National/DoD Cyber Strategies
in summary:
-protect our ideas (it's our future)
-defense crosses borders (WannaCry)

NSA CYBER SECURITY:
-best known for keys, codes, cryptography
--> our devices are used for a LONG TIME. Like a satellite: will this be secure in 40 years?)
-when will quantum computers be available? (much better for cracking codes)

FUTURE OF CYBER:
-cyber automation
-threat intelligence
-tech innovation

EXPERT SKILLS THROUGH WORKPLACE
-education
-recruitment
-development
(and then repeat the cycle)

NSA:
-probably the highest percentage of people with PhDs in cybersecurity (out of all companies)
