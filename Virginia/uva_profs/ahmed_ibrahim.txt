Cybersecurity/IoT/Computer networks/cybersecurity education
Research and also the CyberHoos group...

Questions:
-how can I get a better overview understanding of cyber?
(I tend to feel like I pick things because of "cool applications" not because the tech behind it is cool)
(probably because I don't know enough)
-how should I pick a undergraduate thesis/DMP topic
-any other PhD prep advice??

CYBERHOOS:
-people who work over the summmer
-people who are considering master's degrees
-people who want to learn about malware
-penetration testing next semester
-it's a way of getting committment


CYBERSECURITY:
-ill defined term
-is talked about in Commerse school, Education school, etc (IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS THAN WE DO)
-how can we keep tech from hurting people
-malware/viruses/how malicious software can act on computing devices
-how devices are designed so that there are vulnerabilities
-how websites can have vulnerabilities (forgery/SQLinjection, etc)
-how devices can communicate and things can be intercepted (network security)
-IoT (this is BIGGEST has software that connects to the internet)
-wireless attacks (a big thing that he is doing)
-studying what will happen in 20-50 years (equations and proofs about what WILL work if someone builds it)
-the science of how to break into things
-the active side (AOT passive) of exploitation

IBRAHIM:
-wants to follow multiple branches of cybersecurity and then combine those multiple things
-so this will be much more practical and hands on
-in PhD did protocols (there are no proofs) (later found out you can do it with fewer messages)
-is interested in car hacking
-golden v. silver ticket attacks (on active directories) NEEDS SOMEONE HERE TO WORK ON IT

IS NOT interested in:
-theory
-things you cannot touch/see


MAMUNI (sp):
-does theory (proofs, equations, etc. Not practical)
