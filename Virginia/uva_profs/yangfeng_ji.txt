2018 December 10th
NLP professor

(background: I met with Hanjie Chen,  his PhD student)

HIS RESEARCH:
-trying to get an NLP model to predict and explain why it is predicting that
-is a user review positive or negative
-you can get high accuracy with deep learning
-but don't know why its predicting things
-you want user to be able to know if prediction is justifiable or not
(ie, is it predicting because it saw positive words or...)

CASE 2:
-ML model starting from imperfect/incomplete supervision
-previously, you needed perfect annotation (needed human experts and RELIABLE annotation)
-limitation of that is: difficult and expensive to gather needed data (doctors annotating medical records, etc)
-INSTEAD of annoatation, just ask doctors for a high-level, incomplete annotation
-have to deal with noisy annotation, possibly incorrect annotation, etc. Need strong ML model. 

HIS ADVICE:
-talk to some of his graduate students
-look for a way to collaborate
-if you find a topic you like, help you get start

THE PLAN:
-he'll introduce me to some of his students
-he'll try to help me find a well defined 



QUESTIONS:
-could I take CS6501
(grad level: ask students to present. would need strong background in deep learning)
probably not...
-but you could take the undergrad class (ML will be the prereq and AI would be helpful)

lab is Rice 218

I will email him and ask about meeting people
