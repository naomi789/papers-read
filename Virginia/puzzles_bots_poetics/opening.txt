9:30AM Opening Remarks

Introduction for: 
Join Kate Compton in the Scholars’ Lab for a creative coding workshop on generative programs! Learn how to use Tracery – a super-simple tool and language for generating text, used for making twitterbots, artbots, games, and stories – and how Tracery fits into the world of generativity as a whole. We’ll also be learning about Generominos, generative ideation cards that help you design your interactive artwork, alt-control game, or generative art experiment. Bring your laptop! Everyone is welcome, no coding experience necessary!
Kate Compton is a generative artist, programmer, inventor, and researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who is developing artificial intelligence to augment human creativity. She wrote the popular generative-text language Tracery and the bot-making language Bottery. See her work at galaxykate.com
The Scholars' Lab is sponsoring this workshop as part of the Puzzles, Bots, and Poetics Symposium, being held Friday Oct. 26 – Saturday Oct. 27, 2018, hosted by the Puzzle Poetry Group with support from the Page-Barbour Committee and IHGC.

Kate Compton's talk: 
-context free bots (that don't need context)
-discussion of turing tests for bots that make poetry 
(thinks this is bad idea; besides poets would loose their jobs --- if there are any poets that have jobs)
-went through some examples of bots
-talked about how twitter is considering banning bots (difference between bots and people posting disengenuously)

Twitter examples:
[many of these are built on CHEAP BOTS DONE QUICK]
@infinite_scream # just what it sounds like. People scream back and forth with it. 
@horrible_hogwarts # fan thing, makes about five things on request/patronage
@meka_activated # made by Nora Reed who is one of the biggest users of Compton's tool
@everyonesai # makes mini comic books (fan for "everyone's a robot when you're a robot too) 
@tinycarebot # horecrux discussion
@losttesla # the idea of a "summon" button on a Tesla -> this bot tells you it's experience on a "cross country trip" (can't respond/hear you: IT'S LOST)
Hero and Leander (calling out on different hashtags and not finding each other)

Poetics: 
-she doesn't feel like she knows much about Aristole/poetics, but he says:
1. mimetic
2. serious
3. tells a full story
4. performed (not narrated)
5. rythm/harmony 
6. etc
-needed goals
-needed tools to get there
-etc

Compton feels like we need to have a similar plan for bots

Other commentary: 
-sometimes there is more truth in fiction
-there are things that bots can say that we can't

What is a bot?
-digital assistants
-twitter bots (Olivia Taters, TayTweets, Eliza)
-tangent about the 'rogarian therapist' of Eliza from the 1960s, born in MIT basement
-bots include robots
-some robots draw/make art
-player piano, roomba, lawn sprinkler bots, etc

okay, back to the question:
-autonomous
-generative
-interactive/reactive
-personified

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE AN ALGORITHM EYES?
-personification
-it looks back at you
-it has feelings
-social standing
-it feels us looking at it

Talked about CS games conference
-discussion of flagella and a game that lets you play soccer with it
-how offended conference attendees were that the flagella die
-even through scratching your arm kills flagella

Discussion of forms of autonomy:
-windchimes v. cuckoo clocks 
-trusting very limited bots bc you know they won't do anything else
-intentionally signalling low status (makes people like bots more)
-discussion of Data from Star Trek and how we like him more when he's asking questions "does this beard make me..." or making jokes that don't land
@godtributes (will use a template and your tweet and then combine them)
-there are some "not okay" bots (discussion of the ethics. See Amy [??])
{there are things that people can do but bots CANNOT}
{and remember to take responsibility: what your bot says you have said}
-some bots are like tarot cards

Autonomy as a poetic tool:
-can bots say no? (can an actor say: 'no I dont want to perform hamlet today' is it okay for an actor to say 'once Im on the stage I will read my own poetry instead')
-what is bot consent?

Content generation
-interdementional time traveling space beings in a bar
-resturant management (generating menu based on things)
-generate spoofs (be cautious - it's hard to do people. Can do buzzfeed headlines)
-generating a character (the lost tesla)
-expressings things
-bots as therapy (prayer flag and prayer wheels)

Bots as:
-WALL-E (what bot would you want on earth as the very last bot on earth)
-improv partner (a bot that will give you writing prompts/art assignments/music graphic scores/instrument suggestions)
-generating ways to ceremonial greet your partner
-generating bots to generate code
-generate rhythm and repetion and negative spaces/pause
-parapraxis and juxtaposition
-bots that write the first line of a story ("an angry nun in a wedding dress" or "a weeping priest and a surfer..."
-connected to hemingway "for sale baby shoes never worn" (what if you switch out 'baby' or 'never'
-adding contrast to story "pregnant football player carrying a briefcase"
-remember you don't want EVERYTHING to be as loud as possible
