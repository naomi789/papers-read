computer graphics SIGGRAPH (Adobe publishes a ton, and at a higher rate than usual) 

IBM research (make sure it won't be an engineering position... make sure you'll be allowed to publish (for example, Apple often keeps you from talking about what you do and RARELY publishes. Amazon and Google tends to hire more engineers/less research))

Adobe does both long and short (make product in x < 2 years)  term research. Personally feels that if they don't publish with an intern, then he failed the intern. 

Check with THE RESEARCHER that you get an offer from. Most of these spots are for undergrads (with the exception of WIT scholarship)

Don't turn down an offer without another offer from Microsoft

Nice thing about Adobe is it isn't "one mentor per intern" so it lets you see more things

Trying graphics and vision instead of HCI is okay. 

Adobe is very collaborative, doesn't tear people down



Lincoln Labs = good R&D group
