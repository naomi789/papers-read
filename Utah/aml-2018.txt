Probabilistic Sampling
Gibbs Sampling
Monte Carlo method (iterates over all the nodes)
Markov blanket (is it fixed or not. For some node in space, I need to know it's parents, if there are multiple parents, all of it's children, and all of the childrens' other parents. Does NOT include grandparents). 
Just loop through all the variables 

L -> Z -> W
where Z and N are on a plate N (replicated N times)
and W is observed

f(L,Z,W)
=f(L)*product (i-N)f(Z|L)f(W|Z)
=probability of a label in our universe 

a distribution over categories --> categorical
