apply baye's rule
posterior = (likelihood * prior)/marginal
anchor words: non-zero probability in only one topic (it is zero everywhere else)
does every topic have an anchor? 
co-occurance, talked about linear algebra stuff :)

/users/home/sarahnj <-- put the scripts that make data here (this is super backed up)
users/scratch/users <-- this is not backed up. Put generated data here
/users/data/(<dataset>||<user>) <--this is rated but not backed up 
/local/<users> <-- this is only on my one personal machine, so it will be faster but not accessable anywhere else (maybe put your downloads there, or music that is personal and doesn't need to be backed up)

*yams are potatoes with GPUs
ssh isn't properly set up
