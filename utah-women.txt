PART 1: SETTING THE STAGE

-Biases & Assumptions:
We notice gender, race, age, and then everything else
-Jimmy Carter: "the biggest challenge facing our world today is based on the assumption that men are superior to women"
-Waren Buffet: "I was successful because I was only competing against half of the population"
-The Athena Doctrine (2013 Gerezma D'antonio)
-->people want today's leaders to be more feminimine

WHY WE NEED DIVERSITY
A. Financial
B. Strengthen Organizational Climate
-lower turnover
-higher employee satisfaction
*women are much less likely to embezle... and if they do, usually embezzle less ;)
C. To leverage Talent
-better holistic thinkers
-seek win-win situations
-mor eprocess  oriented
-ask different questions
-bring different experiences
-sensetive to noverbal ques
-comfortable with ambiguity
-different leadership styles
-focus on inclusiveness
-focus on teams, cooporation
-nurturing others
-focus on developing tothers
-more ethical decisions
-higher integrity and honesty
-focus on self development
D. To increase CSR and 
E. Enhance Innovation and Collective Intelligence
-increased innovation
-improved creativity
-better team decision making
-greater team problem solving
-better team performance on highly complex tasks
-increased knowlege formation and patents
-higher collective intelligence
-higher social sensitivity

SO WHO BENEFITS:
-

I HAVE ARRIVED (Natasha G??) a poem

85% of employees are either NOT engaged, or are actively disengaged at work
only 21% feel they are managed in a motivating way
only 3/10 feel like their opinions count

PART 2: ASSESMENT FRAMEWORKS
*looking at women & leadership frameworks
-Unconscious bias trainings <-- getting yourself and your leaders into this is STEP ONE of solving these problems
-1970s blind orchestra auditions --> huge diversity came to be because of that
-incentives for diversity:
--set up automatic incentives; will lead to more equality
(say, choosing to put money in savings for retirement v. happens automatically)

PART 3: BEHAVIORAL DESIGNS
-DESIGNING TO DO THIS:
--> how you advertise and recruit
-Equality and differences
*NOTE TO SELF: I WANT TO READ ABOUT AMBITION. Men = workforce/career ladder; women = broader. Work + family + helping society
*NOTE: Pat Jones' book 

PART 4: THE PROBLEM: / PART 5: 
-unconscious bias --> about 70-80% of it, and diversity training, and sexual harassment training = NOT HELPFUL/makes it worse
-people different fields are more/less likely
-women are usually EITHER likable OR compotent
-social norms
-stastical discrimination (doctor v. nurse, etc)
-stroop test
-harvard unconscious bias
-benevolent sexism
-how to de-bias:
1. know possibility of it
2. understand direction of bias
3. immediate feedback when falling prey
4. training program with regular feedback & coaching
-who should design it
1. needs to know adult learning/pedagogy
2. needs to understand gender
3. 
-stop viewing change as being bad
-->discussion of how to change behavior
-discussion of negotiating wages
-center for creative leadership
-people learn best with challenging assignments (compared to classes, training, etc)
-women get fewer challenging assignments than men!! if they are challenging, 
are usually less desirable
-women get less feedback than men
*NOTE: Read Athena rising (to help men who are scared of mentoring women/giving critical feedback)
-women do not tell the truth during exit interviews
-if you have no data YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO CHANGE
*NOTE: we need to ask students what problems they see in the department
-big data can predict who is likely to leave *NOTE: want to read more about this
-example: Harvard's Brigham and Women Hospital (are women more stressed? less satisfied?)
-QUESTION: HOW DO I DECIDE WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK
-using comparative evaluation (helps people evaluate peoples' performance, instead of stereotypes)
-have many job openings at once often leads to LOWER bias (??)
-watch out for confirmation bias
-UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS ARE BIASED
-"general mental ability in assesments" > reference checks
-panel interviews are often less helpful
-attracting the right people
--> language is gendered ("impact the community" <-- more feminine)

PAY STRUCTURES
-women are more likely to opt-out of competetive pay structures UNLESS they were athletes or speech & debate & are competetive

-women self select by picking jobs that allow more flexibility
-women apply to jobs if they hear others liked them
-women look for: cultural fit, style, etc (more than just money)

-WOMEN VALUE TRANSPARENCY *NOTE* PUT THIS IN SRC
(see handout "analyzing gendered practices")

-HIRING PATTERNS:
(see above)
-are you evaluating them for proven work/their history, or for their potential?

PART 6: DESIGNING SCHOOL & WORK 
-WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RISK:
-women are less likely to guess (UNLESS there is no penalty for wrong guesses/no risk)
-BRAGGING/SELF PROMOTING:
-are we more tollerant of men who want to brag? 
-PERCEPTION OF ABILITY:
-people who are told they are smart/gifted are more likely to succeed/push themselves harder
-stereotype threat--- when told that it is difficult, they do worse
-NOTE: women only networking/leadership training/courses => benefits (QUESTION: ARE YOU SURE??)
-give feedback to help their differences

PART 7: DESIGNING DIVERSITY (see handout)
-comply or explain approach (European countries are setting quotas, and if they aren't complying, then they have to explain)
-that might be forcing hiring women for quotas

PART 8: 
-Utah report findings (women's concerns about being in the workplace)
1. childcare
2. flexibility (not enough permission to tellework, etc)
3. monetary nenefits
4. education
USING SAME WORD W/ DIFFERENT MEANINGS:
-choice
-success
-career
-ambition
CERTIFICATIONS:
-the leadership circle
-something 360?

ABOUT 70% OF WOMEN'S (networking, leadership, etc) PROGRAMS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE

RECOGNIZE YOUR SKILL SETS
-realize your church, etc experience DOES give you skills

LIFE PURPOSE:
-do you have a job? A career? or a calling? 

DO WHAT YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART TO BE RIGHT, FOR YOU'LL BE CRISTICIZED ANYWAY
PARAPHASED: do what you want to because you'll be criticized anyway

CAN YOU LIST YOUR STRENGTHS? (OR ONLY YOUR WEAKNESSES?)








2018 January 30th

KEYNOTE: Utah Judge
finished law school 47 years ago in 1971 (that year TWO women got JDs)
Professional education for members of the judiciary 
Leadership: 1. care 2. challenge (in order to do those, you do not need any experience/power/etc)
never underestimate yourself; never sell yourself short. 
women tend to be "more diffident" about their abilities than men are
"the women lawyers of utah"
--> she and 12 other women started it
--> they were the only 12 at the time
recommended we make groups of people who are like us
#1 
#2 never underestimate it 
#3 just do it
be observant and notice what needs to be done
"if you see something, say something"
"a mature person does not think in absolutes...
has learned there is good & bad in all people and all things
...knowing no one is all-knowing, all of us need both love and charity"


NEXT: BREAK INTO WORKSHOPS
UNDERSTANDING WOMEN'S NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH EACH OTHER:
Dr. Susan R. Madsen UVU Prof. of Leadership & Ethics (PhD from U of Minnesota)
(she was introduced by a woman who just moved here from DC)
She got an email from someone who said this workshop was not appropriate
Cited: Sharon Mavin, Gina Grady, Janniene Williams
Today's contents will help us interact with/manage/lead women & men
-why do women have problems with other women/try to bring them down/not support others?
Competition, jealousy, if many are successful you look less successful because so mnay succeed...
...women compare more: they talk more and rank themselves more, gossip more (?)
-gender differences
Is equality about being the same? 
Talked about how male infants look at mobiles, female ones look at faces. 
Give boys/girls different colors, toys, clothes, chores, allowances, 
Girls are less likely to get an allowance for doing chores--- so women are more likely to feel obligated to "serve"
More likely to comment on a girls' appearance, boys' brains
Acceptable for boys to roughhouse. If they fight, they are friends soon after. Girls... less so. 
When girls race, they're more likely to hold hands & run together than to try and win, or wait to see scores together. 
!!90% of female CEOs did sports OR speech&debate in high school 
-the sisterhood stereotype
women are expected to keep things equal
relationships often grounded in emotional/psychological processes
*women who rise in leaddership OFTEN HAVE FEWER FRIENDS. Less women up there & they have broken the rules --> judged differently by other women
-gender differences in the workspace
for men: 
are expected to be competetive (when m/f say "I could beat you at ___ sport" what do you think?)
for women:
women struggle to be friends with those whom they compete (UNLESS they are used to sports/debate & competing)
-how women compete:
indirectly. Is socially acceptable. 
About bodies. Social media, plastic surgery, TV... this is getting worse!!
"token woman minority" feeling like there is only room for one, so I need to keep my spot safe. 
Are more easily offended than men. 
Are quicker to "play games"
-Micro Violance/psychosocial relations
-Women are encouraged to protect themselves from each other:
the girl's guide to being a boss: without being a bitch
play like a man, win like a woman
that bitch: protect yourself from women with malicious intent
-Female Misogyny (dislike/contempt/prejudice from women against women)
is usually unconsicious 
-women are taught that all women should be equal
-and that they should be service-focused
-TIMES MAGAZINE: don't hate her because she is successful
-women who desire/obtain power USUALLY fail to live up to feminine stereotype
*READ: THE CONFIDENCE CODE
-as women move up, they are overthrowing traditional "sisterhood" things
*she keeps saying: "if you find this hard, read the slides again later if the words are too difficult"
I find that a little demeaning... But then again, I've specialized in this.
-politics
there are entire committees & subcommittees that DO NOT HAVE women on them in Utah government
when men are 50-60% qualified, they'll try it. Women won't unless 90-100% qualified. 
women need to "be tapped" 
-organizations:
most are hierarchical (bc men made them)
companies founded by women tend to be equally effective but DIFFERENT
leaders=> image of old white male
when women rise they are held to different standards than male counterpoints
women leaders appear "socially unattractive"
discussion of stereotyping--- you have one bad female coworker, then "all women" are "bad"
queen bee, iron woman
learning from moms, sisters, teachers, women at church. What do they talk about? Their weight?
-Rumination:
overthinking WAY more than men do. 
more likely to dwell on the problem rather than look for a solution (biological reasons??)
*training self to do this less!! Can freeze decision making, action, drain confidence. 
examples: what was evveryone else thinking? Why did I do that? I should have said __. 
-perfectionism
Women usually feel inadequate, it halts action
makes us feel down, sometimes makes us want to bring others down
-deflecting praise:
It was just luck. I was just in the right place @ the right time. Everyone else did the work. 
--> how can we deflect praise AND be humble? Not/deflecting is bad. BOTH. 
-unconscious bias. 
judge based on gender, then race, then age, then other generalizations
