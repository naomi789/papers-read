Steven Drucker = host of data visualization lunches
Speaker = UW PhD student
Tool = "Draco"

visualizations --> logic constraints
our knowledge of design --> constraints
1. domain of attributes
2. integrity constraints
3. preferences (most are soft, do not HAVE to be met)

went through examples of how to use draco (what kind of inputs it can deal with)

things to learn more about:
-what is a strip plot? (just an un-binned histogram?)
