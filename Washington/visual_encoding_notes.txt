-nominal (Nominal is a Name; identifies an area via a zip code, soccer player via jersey number, etc)
-ordinal (Ordinal is for Order; says if someone is first, second, third in line)
-quantitative (is numbers)
-integral visual channels (color, size, etc)
-seperable visual channels (x and size, etc)
-univariate encodings (from Voyager? Univariate Summaries show distributions for all data fields when no focus view is specified. )k
-perceptual kernels (from Bernstein: "distance matrices derived from aggregate perceptual judgments")
-distributed (or ensemble) visual information
-value tasks (reading or comparing individual values)
-summary tasks (comparing two averages, deciding which group has max value, etc)
-expressiveness (described a visualization as expressive if a visualization encodes all relevant informations and only that information)
-effectiveness (effectiveness criteria means that all information is presented clearly. This excludes cluttered screens.)

var in this paper:
-cardinality (a measure of the number of elements in a set) (Cardinal is for Counting; measures "how many")
-#/category
-entropy (measure of disorder in a dataset)
-correlation (any statistical association, but usually a linear one)
-clusteredness (a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together)

tasks:
-value tasks (require reading/comparing individual values)
-summary tasks (you identify or compare aggregate properties)
