GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
DATA SCIENCE 101
FRANK TURNER

-data = facts and statistics that were gathered
-science = doing something with it

-data science (interdisciplinary way of studying)
-you need:
-programming skills
-math/statistics knowledge
-business acumen/domain expertise
-communication skills

-data engineer:
-takes data and structures it in such a way that it can be analyzed easily

-what data science does:
-"beautiful soup" (???)
-scrape, munge, and sample business data
-visualize data
-understand data relationships
-tell the machine how to learn from data
-create data products that deliver actionable insight
-tell relevant business stories from data

-'data science is 80\% being a data janitor and cleaning data'

-data science work flow

-packages
(see ppt)

-pandas data frames and R data frames are the same
-column = a series
-lets you manipulate data without having to iterate through rows

-scikit learn (open source data)
-helps with preprocessing/cleaning
-and modeling
-and scoring how well you did

-numpy and scipy
-matplotlib and seaborn (sp?)
-(better than excel or tableu)
-statsmodel (WM) good for evaluating data science models
-beautiful soup and selenium (was initially for testing but also lets you scrape stuff from html sites)

-I ignored the next 60 minutes of his talk (explaining what algorithms were, etc)
-now he's talking about jupyter hotkeys etc

JUPYTER
-shift+enter or control+enter (also causes it to save)
-go to kernel and 'restart + run all'

CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS:
-story of a 17yo girl who got an email from target geared towards expectant mothers
-her dad sent a livid email
-a month later she found out she was female

things to try:
-codecademy
-code school
-codewars.com
-other framework? try spark

want more?
-listed a bunch of textbooks for data science
-then books for math/statistics
-then busines books
-suggested part time and full time data science courses

MOOCs
-free classes that you can take online
-Andrew Ng's ML class on coursera
