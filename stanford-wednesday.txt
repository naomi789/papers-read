The first field takes forever, it'll be easier to get into your second field
think of the vibes of different labs, make sure you like the people that you will be working with
greedy algorithm in life choices, can produce global optimmal results
LISTEN TO THAT VOICE INSIDE who says "but what I really want to do is.."
--> especially with work life balance, picking a major, etc
Talked about BYU recruiting women faculty
--> risk of not getting tenure
-->is your hubby disabled 
--> three is the magic number to get women into leadershp (two can be odd.... like if they both vote a ccertain way, or vote different (cat fight)... tokenizing them.)
Overall advice:
-make your resume who you are
-but kinda need to hide the fact that I love education, possibly... Depends on what I want to do
-BUT I shouldn't be silencing and supress
Always be quick to do things I love--- maybe aim really high (more technical) and then you can reevaluate after 6 months if it makes me miserable)

July 19th Meeting
Mark Guzdial  at Georgia Tech 
Andy Ko at UW


if you have 1000 students or 2000 students in class, how can the professors/TAs grade let alone give feedback?
Huang (sp?) made pollock-looking 3D map/art to show different in/correct solutions
1. how do humans learn from examples??
SOCIAL SOLUTIONS
-peer groups
-home enviro
-communities of practice
-identity
-mindset
TEACHING STRATEGIES:
-(like ten diff ones)
...
-learning from examples (example  variation)
-"the hitchhiker's guide to python" (contrasting good and bad, examples of what a rule is)
*discussion of the new movie "Arrival"
*discussion of the importance of education/psychology papers to her work
-anological transfers. Showing a photo and helping a computer know what is a laptop (generalizing from two examples) 
-strategic diversity (right v. wrong)
-superficial features (doesn't affect membership: can have a lot of variation but all still fall into this category) 
-show a bunch of variants of one attribute (colors: no matter the color, it is one)
-fusion: do all the above examples, mixing it all  up

2. How do overCode & FooBaz help downstrea, human learning from examples?
-want teacher to learn about their class/students
-want to help students learn about code
DIMENSIONS OF SOLUTION VARIATION:
-standardize formatting, remove comments, pick good var names, ignore statement order, and syntax. 
-talked about how to do some of that
-then look at the unique sets

I was a little confused when she talked about the num of solutions teachers viewed in 15 minutes? 
Ahh, she made it a little more clear later. 

Importancce of downstream learning from examples (teacher <--> student)

FOOBAZ: 
different workflow
talked about the importance of variable names

MAIN TAKE AWAY:
-importance of making (good) generalizations through good examples
-the idea of showing these results to different students (worried beginners might be overwhelmed)
-noticing people who use which textbook v. professor v. school has coding-cultural-differentials (variable names can havve numbers or not. Using "too much" recursion or not. "Best solution" is easiest v. fastest etc).
-the idea of translating variables btw languages

MY QUESTIONS:
what is inductive programming?
am i interested in "program analysis"?
why does Prof. Bernstein always ask questions that seem most helpful? 




(prep for) July 19th meeting
Elena L. Glassman: EECS PhD from MIT, currently a postdoc
note: look at her "programming education at scale" stuff!!

July 12th meeting
Professor Sriram Subramanian from the University of Sussex. 
Title: Manipulating acoustic wave fronts for mid-air haptics and displays
*scented-fog filled computer-produced bubbles (instead of 2D digital bubbles that alert you when someone texts/messages you
*MistForm was a 3D grid thing projector/delio
ACM CHI 2012 ultratangibles (moving stuff on top of a tablet) 
ACM UIST 2012 (now defying gravity single beads, multiples, in grids, with physical interaction, etc)
(point of those two things is that they can use ultrasonic speakers to levitate things)
can flip, rotate with tailored electronic field 
JOLED (is the name of the bead levitator?)
needs pressure amplitude to be a minimum 
gor'kov potential on small sperical particles
(bead was small, 2-3milimeters and sperical, so they could treat it as a point)
three different ways to  trap an item (while levitating it)
-twin
-vortex
-bottle
Patrick Haggard 2002 (reporting your percieved action and when you think the outcome occurs)
... I am a little confused? Is that like the difference between when you touch the key v. press down v. come up
used a "libet clock" 
talking about the difference in perception of when an event started v. ended based on if it was visual (seeing a video of a button being pressed) or vibrotactile or mid-air. 

*most disappointing part of this talk is the fact that his presentation of how the experiment was set up was so confusing that we spent a lot of our time trying to understand that. He probably should've made a five minute video showing what was happening. 
(I feel like Bernstein also is not super impressed with this guy's explanations/something about this)
they also tried audio feedback too

questions people asked/I thought:
-people have more experience with visual interfaces. How much did/goes/can that change the results (results being that visual interfaces are much more precise than vibrotactile or mid-air)

Invited us to sign up for the academic demo (and they are selling this in Palo Alto)
