Beyond Weiser: From Ubiquitous to Collective Computing (Gregory D. Abowd 2016 IEEE)
Referred to Mark Weiser's work and the idea of ubiquitous computing being part of the "third wave" (and again, "having vision")
Generation 1: the mainframe comp (1936 Alan Turning, machines to fight WWII, many people would share the same comp, repurposing the machine for post war uses)
Generation 2: the PC (Douglas Englebart NLS/Augment 1968??, Xerox and the first PC. Not widely used until the spreadsheet became a thing)
Generation 3: ubiquitous computing (when one person would have multiple devices (Ken Sakamura, UTokyo), multiple sizes and multiple capabilities, discussion of how phones became a thing, interaction capabilities grew)
Generation 4: what do we need next?? 
-devices that promote human-human interaction
-getting different devices to synchronize/improving the cloud
-crowd sourcing (I don't think I knew that was a thing until I met Prof. Bernstein)
-wearables (and other connections between digital and physical (aka cyborgs))

The Computer for the 21st century (Mark Weiser 1991)
The idea that once computers "disappear" that they are indistinguishable and better because we don't notice how used they are
Esentially, he described what CS would just be becoming, over 15 years before it happened (and some of it still hasn't happened in 2017)
Essentially, he knew what he wanted and described that. What do I want CS to become? What kind of questions do I want to work on??

The Xerox Star: A Retrospective. Johnson et al. 1989
-discusses the desktop computer and which of its ideas were new
--> this is pretty much the description of why modern computers are like this
-see section "direct manipulation" on page 14 re: why we have the UI that we do
--> difference between UI/UX being intuitive v. users having experience using it v. etc what is a "good" UI/UX
-Ivan Sutherlang, 1960's, creating sketchpad
(why do I struggle to be interested in graphics, robots, etc? I find history really interested, but not inventing anything related...)


Man-Computer Symbiosis (J. C. R. Licklider 1960)
-Mechanically Extended Man != AI
-semi-automatic... implication that = processes that we COULDN'T fully automate
-discusses the idea that programmers became better/more logical/clearer thinkers THROUGH programming
-->proof? would be interesting to study...
-importance of getting computers to work in "real time"
-85% of his time was prep time. Gathering info, making it comparable, graphing it--- then would look at graph for few seconds only
-does the ACM website suggest papers to read (related to what you say you are studying?) (google can do that)
-Reminds of some CHI opening speakers/talks (discussion of where the field is going, etc)? 
-->I find  that a little weird (probably mostly because I disagreed with several of the speakers... Like that MIT talk...)
-I am less interested in the hardware, discussions of how memory storage does/should work
*if we can quantify colors... when will we be able to quantify smells? 
-speech recognition


As We May Think (Vannevar Bush 1945) 
-what do I think we will invent in the future?
-what do I want the future to be like?
-in what direction is the future headed?
-do people who make good predictions=foresighted? Or do they just make MANY predictions?
*this was written in 1940-ish fonts. How and WHY (bc they are new? Conserve ink? Paper? Someone cool starts using that font?)... do fonts change?
*pg 116 re:VAT and synchronizing data, time, photos, etc
-how bad of an idea is it to get inspiration from old predictions of the future? papers AOT pop culture/sci fi?
-I wonder if this was all his predictions that he was super confident on. If so, what were the ideas he deemed less likely?
-pg 121 re: sorting data, possibly topic modeling? 
-how many articles like this got published (this was The Atlantic though) and have been ignored because so far they are wrong?
-how did the author decide these things will happen? (essentially he was doing the rough draft of the research: didn't know where it would come from/how these things would be made, but he said "what if" and made a "wish list"/"bucket list" thing)
-what can I do to become a better thinker?
