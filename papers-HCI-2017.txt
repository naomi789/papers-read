The Xerox Star: A Retrospective. Johnson et al. 1989
-discusses the desktop computer and which of its ideas were new
-see section "direct manipulation" on page 14 re: why we have the UI that we do
--> difference between UI/UX being intuitive v. users having experience using it v. etc what is a "good" UI/UX

Man-Computer Symbiosis (J. C. R. Licklider 1960)
-Mechanically Extended Man != AI
-semi-automatic... implication that = processes that we COULDN'T fully automate
-discusses the idea that programmers became better/more logical/clearer thinkers THROUGH programming
-->proof? would be interesting to study...
-importance of getting computers to work in "real time"
-85% of his time was prep time. Gathering info, making it comparable, graphing it--- then would look at graph for few seconds only
-does the ACM website suggest papers to read (related to what you say you are studying?) (google can do that)
-Reminds of some CHI opening speakers/talks (discussion of where the field is going, etc)? 
-->I find  that a little weird (probably mostly because I disagreed with several of the speakers... Like that MIT talk...)
-I am less interested in the hardware, discussions of how memory storage does/should work
*if we can quantify colors... when will we be able to quantify smells? 
-speech recognition


As We May Think (Vannevar Bush 1945) 
-what do I think we will invent in the future?
-what do I want the future to be like?
-in what direction is the future headed?
-do people who make good predictions=foresighted? Or do they just make MANY predictions?
*this was written in 1940-ish fonts. How and WHY (bc they are new? Conserve ink? Paper? Someone cool starts using that font?)... do fonts change?
*pg 116 re:VAT and synchronizing data, time, photos, etc
-how bad of an idea is it to get inspiration from old predictions of the future? papers AOT pop culture/sci fi?
-I wonder if this was all his predictions that he was super confident on. If so, what were the ideas he deemed less likely?
-pg 121 re: sorting data, possibly topic modeling? 
-how many articles like this got published (this was The Atlantic though) and have been ignored because so far they are wrong?
-how did the author decide these things will happen? (essentially he was doing the rough draft of the research: didn't know where it would come from/how these things would be made, but he said "what if" and made a "wish list"/"bucket list" thing)
-what can I do to become a better thinker?
