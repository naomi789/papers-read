Reflective Physical Prototyping through Integrated Design, Test, and Analysis (Michael Bernstein and other stanford HCI people) 
seems applicable to Big Widgets/Berries/other prototyping things from BYU HCI

Webzeitgeist (Stanford, MIT, and INTEL)
WOW I NEED A WEB DESIGN CRAWLER (re: Edna/DesignBot/for this summer internship)

Interactive Sketchingfor the Early Stages of UI Design (James Landay and Brad Meyers)
-idea that people give better feedback when tool/UI/draft looks like a "work in progress" = seems so so true to me

Towards a Better Understanding of Context and Context-Awareness (five MIT people, UIST 2013)
pretty much, I am currently not very interested in 3D printing/3D interfaces/robots/drones/etc
Cool idea though, especially once I thought of this in context of star trek and weird interfaces :)
*we watched their video and the coolness factor went up 30000% wow

Towards a Better Understanding of Context and Context-Awareness (Anind K. Dey and Gregory D. Abowd from Georgia Tech HUC 1999)
Seemed to be an overview of how far we have gotten with context-aware computing and how much farther we have to go
(could I write a paper like this about language learning?? and publish it in a similar conference?)

HyperSlides: Dynamic Presenting Prototyping (Microsoft Research)
People make powerpoint slides that are "slideuments" so people read them as if they are documents, instead of listening to the presenter
Discussion of "add ons" (interaction/zoomability with slides, non-linear powerpoints, multi-screen, crowd feedback, etc)
Five main "canons of rhetoric" 1. invention 2. arrangement 3. style 4.memory 5. delivery
Overall, presentations = just containers 

Wikipedians are born not made (Minneappolis)
Your first experience in a community dramatically influences the way you percieve/decide if you are going to stay or not. 
People thought that you would get more experience and then become a more active editor, not necessarily the case. 
Asks the questions: why join it/what gets people to stay? 
Talked about word2vec and how languages change in online communities 
90% OF WIKI EDITORS ARE MALE?!

Soylent: A Word Processor with a Crowd Inside (Bernstein UIST 2010)
Why did they name this Soylent?? (beause "soylent" was "made" out of humans)
"find fix verify" Have three sets of people, one to do each. 
Problem groups: "eager beavers" (people who would overachieve) and "lavy turker" people who did the bare minimum 
-find fix verify 
-Crowdproof-
-shortening-
-the human macro-
parallelism issues: if you shorten one paragraph, you had to shorten others. 
Talked about how much microsoft word can catch, plus how much turks can catch ==> great
LEGAL OWNERSHIP: should these people have any rights towards the data they provide/editing they do? 
(what about people who suggest ideas AOT simple edits like in this project) 
Great discussion about "our data" and what happens when we get adds targeted towards us, etc

Beyond Weiser: From Ubiquitous to Collective Computing (Gregory D. Abowd 2016 IEEE)
Referred to Mark Weiser's work and the idea of ubiquitous computing being part of the "third wave" (and again, "having vision")
Generation 1: the mainframe comp (1936 Alan Turning, machines to fight WWII, many people would share the same comp, repurposing the machine for post war uses)
Generation 2: the PC (Douglas Englebart NLS/Augment 1968??, Xerox and the first PC. Not widely used until the spreadsheet became a thing)
Generation 3: ubiquitous computing (when one person would have multiple devices (Ken Sakamura, UTokyo), multiple sizes and multiple capabilities, discussion of how phones became a thing, interaction capabilities grew)
Generation 4: what do we need next?? 
-devices that promote human-human interaction
-getting different devices to synchronize/improving the cloud
-crowd sourcing (I don't think I knew that was a thing until I met Prof. Bernstein)
-wearables (and other connections between digital and physical (aka cyborgs))

The Computer for the 21st century (Mark Weiser 1991)
The idea that once computers "disappear" that they are indistinguishable and better because we don't notice how used they are
Esentially, he described what CS would just be becoming, over 15 years before it happened (and some of it still hasn't happened in 2017)
Essentially, he knew what he wanted and described that. What do I want CS to become? What kind of questions do I want to work on??

The Xerox Star: A Retrospective. Johnson et al. 1989
-discusses the desktop computer and which of its ideas were new
--> this is pretty much the description of why modern computers are like this
-see section "direct manipulation" on page 14 re: why we have the UI that we do
--> difference between UI/UX being intuitive v. users having experience using it v. etc what is a "good" UI/UX
-Ivan Sutherlang, 1960's, creating sketchpad
(why do I struggle to be interested in graphics, robots, etc? I find history really interested, but not inventing anything related...)


Man-Computer Symbiosis (J. C. R. Licklider 1960)
-Mechanically Extended Man != AI
-semi-automatic... implication that = processes that we COULDN'T fully automate
-discusses the idea that programmers became better/more logical/clearer thinkers THROUGH programming
-->proof? would be interesting to study...
-importance of getting computers to work in "real time"
-85% of his time was prep time. Gathering info, making it comparable, graphing it--- then would look at graph for few seconds only
-does the ACM website suggest papers to read (related to what you say you are studying?) (google can do that)
-Reminds of some CHI opening speakers/talks (discussion of where the field is going, etc)? 
-->I find  that a little weird (probably mostly because I disagreed with several of the speakers... Like that MIT talk...)
-I am less interested in the hardware, discussions of how memory storage does/should work
*if we can quantify colors... when will we be able to quantify smells? 
-speech recognition


As We May Think (Vannevar Bush 1945) 
-what do I think we will invent in the future?
-what do I want the future to be like?
-in what direction is the future headed?
-do people who make good predictions=foresighted? Or do they just make MANY predictions?
*this was written in 1940-ish fonts. How and WHY (bc they are new? Conserve ink? Paper? Someone cool starts using that font?)... do fonts change?
*pg 116 re:VAT and synchronizing data, time, photos, etc
-how bad of an idea is it to get inspiration from old predictions of the future? papers AOT pop culture/sci fi?
-I wonder if this was all his predictions that he was super confident on. If so, what were the ideas he deemed less likely?
-pg 121 re: sorting data, possibly topic modeling? 
-how many articles like this got published (this was The Atlantic though) and have been ignored because so far they are wrong?
-how did the author decide these things will happen? (essentially he was doing the rough draft of the research: didn't know where it would come from/how these things would be made, but he said "what if" and made a "wish list"/"bucket list" thing)
-what can I do to become a better thinker?
